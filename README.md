# Exploring Temporal and Spatial Patterns of Major Crime Indicators in City of Toronto


## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of temporal and spatial trends in major crime indicators in Toronto from 2014 to 2024. The project aims to understand the relationship between crime rates, time, and geographical factors, using the Toronto Major Crime Indicators dataset. The findings inform targeted crime prevention strategies and policy recommendations. Linear regression models were applied to identify key predictors of crime rates, and visualizations were used to highlight trends and patterns across neighborhoods and timeframes.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` Contains the original data on crime incidents as obtained from the City of Toronto's open data portal.
-   `data/analysis_data` Contains the cleaned and processed dataset used for analysis.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of the chat tool, Chat-GPT. The words parts of introduction and anlysis for graphs also were written with the help of Chat-GPT and the entire chat history is available in other/llm/usage.txt.
